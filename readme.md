## Topology1 Readme
### Project structure
#### topology1_journal.md
Please see topology1_journal.md or my personal website for further details.

#### /python_config
This python script is used to configure the network devices. It uses netmiko and contains python structured data for the topology.

#### /node_config
This folder contains files for configuring the nodes. It is for cut and paste and not for automation. I am not currently using it for Cisco devices. You can find Cisco commands in the journal or python scripts.

#### /ansible
The ansible directory contains little. I am not currently working with ansible. The inventory is far from complete.
